Summary: Outlining the blog's theme
Status: draft

# Outline

- base it on bootstrap for ease of styling and responsive design
- want a minimal look so it doesn't look like a flashy bootstrap site
- html5 compliant with structural/semantic tags and appropriate metadata (research for this)
- don't care about older browsers?
- do care about mobile
- control over theme, including upgrading bootstrap and other dependencies
- metatags:
	- feeds
	- rel links
	- og tags
	- twitter tags
	- other social networks?
	- meta tags like author, etc
