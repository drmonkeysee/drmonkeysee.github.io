Summary: Obligatory hello world post

In the finest tradition of new projects this is the hello world post for my dev log aka blog of other stuff too. The intent here is to document my work on various projects on my Github account, so naturally the log itself should *also* be a project on my Github account. And here we are.

This first entry is a test of the publishing system itself and I imagine I'll be tweaking it a bit before it actually shows up live anywhere. The breakdown: I'm using [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.6.3/index.html) as the blog publisher and generally following [this guide](http://ntanjerome.org/blog/how-to-setup-github-user-page-with-pelican/) to get it all working. A nice surprise, the latest version of Pelican seems to support Github pages publishing directly so I may not need the branch-dance documented in the guide. I'm also checking [mathamy](http://mathamy.com) and [fuzzy notepad](http://eev.ee) as a guide for organization. If it all works out my next entry will probably detail exactly how I got this blog set up.

Things I need to figure out:

- themes
- plugins I may want
- different sections n' stuff for the site
- what the heck are all the right settings

Here we go!
