Summary: Time for a blog pause
Date: 2016-02-03

I gave it a shot but I don't think I can sustain a long-form dev log right now. The fact of the matter is hands-on-keyboard time is a limited resource and I use a lot of it at work. If I spend the remainder of it writing about side-projects then I don't have anything left for working on side-projects.

So for now, at least, I'm halting work on this particular experiment. I'll leave it up 'cuz why not, perhaps I'll come back to it someday, and I may continue tinkering with the theme. But updating it regularly is not a smart use of my time or my physical resources. 

My intent was to document the meandering path of progress and random excursions that come up when developing software, particularly for problems I haven't tackled before. I think I can more or less achieve this on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/drmonkeysee) so feel free to follow me there to stay up to date.

It's not a total loss either way. I got a chance to exercise GitHub pages and build a blog workflow using Pelican. That's the whole point of GitHub: explore new technology or interesting problems, learn what you can from the experience, and dump it on the Internet for everyone to judge you!

Anyway that's it. For now this is me, signing off.
