</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>For starters, I recognize the irony of not posting for several days immediately after I defined a posting schedule. New year's resolutions never work! However that's not the whole of it.</p>
<p>If I may, I'm going to get a bit personal here. I've been a professional programmer for about fifteen years. As a kid I spent a lot of leisure time on the computer and that continued through college and into my professional years. It's safe to say I've spent the majority of my life at a keyboard. For people with certain habits or genetic predispositions or whatever, that comes at a cost. I've dealt with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury">RSI</a> in the wrists, back, and shoulder for several years now. Generally it's manageable, but when my career and my hobbies both involve keyboards and mice sometimes there simply isn't enough stamina to go around, and for obvious reasons career takes precedent.</p>
<p>By and large I can manage it but for whatever combination of factors coalesced in December and January I've had to take it much slower and easier than normal and that means avoiding computers when I don't absolutely have to use them. Correspondingly, the hobby projects (like this blog) suffer.</p>
<p>The upshot is I shouldn't have tried to set a regular update schedule and won't try to stick to one. I will try to post something semi-regularly (every 2-3 weeks would be ideal) and hopefully things get back on track. I've got a lot of random things I'd like to work on, not the least of which is the theme of this blog, but these projects are going to have to progress at a rate I can sustain.</p>
<p>So that's what's up! I'm not giving up on this project, nor the other ones for which this blog exists in the first place. But I will have to be diligent in terms of the time and effort I can dedicate to them.</p>
